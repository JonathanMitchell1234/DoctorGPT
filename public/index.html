      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      Hello, if you're reading this, you're probably checking out my work.
      LawGPT is a project I created over a few days to optimize the use of prompts for legal issues with GPT-3.5 Turbo.
      It aims to improve access to quality legal advice for people who can't afford it.
      LawGPT's Developer is a Software Engineering student at Western Governors University, and is currently looking for a full-time position in Web Development or
      Software Engineering. If you're interested in hiring me, please use the contact form.

      LawGPT is open-source and open to any contributions.
      LawGPT is not a substitute for a lawyer, and you should not rely on it solely for legal advice.
      LawGPT is not affiliated with OpenAI, GPT-3, or GPT-3.5 Turbo.
      The creator of LawGPT is not a lawyer, and is not responsible for any legal advice given by LawGPT.
